# Endless-Crafting

Made by Sunpui

Fixed by TerableCoder

This module will keep crafting the last crafted item and use Crafter's Cure (Elite is default, replace id in file to change deafult). 
Also requires command module

If you have a S_FATIGABILITY_POINT error ask your fellow exploiter friend for the opcode

1. Type: /8 craft

2. Craft the item you want to continuously craft once

3. To disable type: /8 craft

Additional commands:

"/8 craft linkedItem" switches pp consumable
(You can link items in chat with Ctrl+LMB)

"/8 craft unlock" if your character is still stuck 5 seconds after disabling
