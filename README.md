# Endless-Crafting

This module will keep crafting the last crafted item and use Crafter's Cure (Elite is default, replace id in file to change deafult). 
Also requires command module. Works for both S_FATIGABILITY_POINT.3.def structures!

If you have a S_FATIGABILITY_POINT error ask your fellow exploiter friend for the opcode

1. Type: /8 craft

2. Craft the item you want to continuously craft once

3. To disable type: /8 craft

## Config
### `enable`
- Is the module on by default or not?
### `cureId`
- The default is elite crafters cure: 182439, you can change the default to normal crafters cure: 181100

## Additional commands:

"/8 craft linkedItem" switches pp consumable
(You can link items in chat with Ctrl+LMB)

"/8 craft unlock" if your character is still stuck 5 seconds after disabling
